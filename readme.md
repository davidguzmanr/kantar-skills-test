# Wells Fargo Pricing Data

## Description of data

The attached data file (skills_test.csv) contains text data pertaining to Wells
Fargo, a US bank. This data includes documents sourced from a variety of 
platforms including Twitter, Facebook, blogs and forums.

There are two columns in the data file. `Text` contains the main data. `label`
contains a binary label indicating whether the document is about `pricing` (1)
or not (0).

## Description of tasks

You have two tasks:
1) classify documents based on whether or not they discuss pricing
2) summarise the dataset

These tasks give us insight into your technical and methodological knowledge
as well as your curiosity, creativity and ability to pick up new methods 
quickly. Good luck!

#### Task 1: classification

Your task is to correctly classify the 
documents into classes 0 and 1 (i.e. about 'pricing' or not).

You will get extra "points" for trying a variety of NLP relevant classification approaches. What is the state of the art? What is the most achievable in the timeframe? 

We want to see a notebook or script summarising the techniques you tried 
and the results you received. We're interested in how you quantify the 
results of the various techniques that you try too please so don't forget
to report that. The F1 score (harmonic mean) is a good option here.

#### Task 2: describe & summarise

We are also interested in your ability to make sense of the data. Please 
tell us what's in this dataset? Here are some areas that you might consider 
looking into to help tell your story: frequent terms, topic modelling (LDA, 
word2vec, etc.), influential users, sentiment, emotion, network diagrams, etc. 

## What we need from you at the end

Please provide us with the script(s) (preferably in a notebook format) you 
used to create your outputs as well as a write-up of your findings (you 
could integrate this into your notebook, or a separate document). Please also 
include any supporting visuals (these could be embedded in your notebook, 
a Word file, PowerPoint, etc.). Story-telling and clarity is important here!

Also note this isnt a test in the form of right and wrong answers, we want to do a mini-emulation of how you would approach this kind of R&D task at Kantar. Also we will discuss with you your work here in the 2nd stage interviews so please be prepared to say why you made the decisions you made and understand what approaches you have implemented. 

Be creative and clear, and have fun!

Live long and prosper ðŸ––
